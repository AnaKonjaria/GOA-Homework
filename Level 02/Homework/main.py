#Code is executed from the top to bottom, line by line. 
#We have to create variable before calling it, so first line will be declaring a variable, the next line will be print() function.
#Debugging consists of two steps: identifying bug and fixing it. Examples:

#

#Here are fixed bugs examples:

print('hello world')
name = 'Ana'
name2 = 'Anna'
age = 28
surname = 'konjaria'
print(surname)

#building a sentence using variables:
print(name, surname, 'is', age, 'years old.')

#repeating numerical data:

print(5+5)
print(3*5)
print(5/2)
print(5//2)
print(3-1)
